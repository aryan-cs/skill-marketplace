# Personal Skill Marketplace

A personal [plugin marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces) for building and versioning your own [skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills). **The repo is the marketplace; git is the versioned history.**

## How it works

This repo is one marketplace (`aryan-skills`) that ships one plugin (`personal`). Every skill you write lives inside that plugin under `plugins/personal/skills/`. You install the plugin once; after that, editing a skill is just a commit + push, and pulling the change is a `/plugin update`.

The `quality-review` skill is a **working example** — keep it, edit it, or delete the folder.

## Skills

Installed skills appear in the `/` menu as `/personal:<name>`, and auto-trigger when a request matches their description.

- **[`quality-review`](plugins/personal/skills/quality-review/)** — reviews a code diff or pull request for correctness bugs, security issues, performance problems, and readability, reporting findings by severity with concrete fixes.
- **[`setup-claude-code`](plugins/personal/skills/setup-claude-code/)** — bootstraps a machine's Claude Code setup: forces Opus + full ultracode as the default (via shell env vars and a wrapper), installs [agent-yes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agent-yes) with the auto-approve `claude` wrapper, and adds macOS keep-awake helpers so agents survive a closed laptop lid. Ships tested `check-policy`/`setup`/`verify` scripts.
- **[`check-paper`](plugins/personal/skills/check-paper/)** — reviews an academic (ML/CS) paper and its figures against a full submission checklist: narrative prose, a results-first abstract, hand-checked citations, structure & venue-template compliance, anonymization, reproducibility & rigor, no em dashes / no AI-sounding writing, and figure/table standards (Turbo colormap, semantic color, spacing, legible labels). Bundles a ready-to-use arXiv/NeurIPS-style preprint template plus citation and AI-tell checker scripts.

## Install it (once, on any machine)

Inside a Claude Code session:

```
/plugin marketplace add aryan-cs/skill-marketplace
/plugin install personal@aryan-skills
```

`personal@aryan-skills` is `<plugin-name>@<marketplace-name>`. The marketplace name is the `name` field in `marketplace.json` — not the repo name.

Your skills then appear in the `/` menu, namespaced by the plugin: `/personal:quality-review`.

## Add a new skill

Fastest path — scaffold, then edit:

```
./scripts/new-skill.sh my-new-skill
```

That creates `plugins/personal/skills/my-new-skill/SKILL.md` from a template. Fill in the `description` (it's what makes Claude auto-trigger the skill) and the body. See **[docs/authoring-skills.md](docs/authoring-skills.md)** for the full guide.

Test it locally without publishing:

```
claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/personal
# then, in the session:
/reload-plugins
/personal:my-new-skill
```

## Publish a change

1. **Bump the version** in `plugins/personal/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (e.g. `0.1.0` → `0.2.0`) and add a line to `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Commit, tag, and push:
   ```
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Add my-new-skill"
   git tag v0.2.0
   git push && git push --tags
   ```
3. Pull it wherever the plugin is installed:
   ```
   /plugin marketplace update aryan-skills
   /plugin update personal
   /reload-plugins
   ```

> **Why the version bump matters.** `/plugin update` is a **no-op if the version string didn't change**. If you push new skill content but forget to bump `version` in `plugin.json`, installed copies won't update. (Alternatively: delete the `version` line entirely and every commit auto-versions by its git SHA — convenient while iterating heavily, at the cost of clean release numbers. Pick one; don't do both.)

## Versioning model — the rules that bite

- A plugin's version resolves from `plugin.json` → else the marketplace entry → else the git commit SHA. Keep `version` in **one place only** (`plugin.json`). Never also put it in the marketplace entry — `plugin.json` wins silently and can mask it.
- `git tag vX.Y.Z` on each release gives you the human-readable versioned history; `git log` gives per-skill history for free.
- To pin an install to an exact commit/tag, add a `ref` or `sha` to the plugin's `source` object in `marketplace.json` (see the [plugins reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference)).

## Notes

- Skills are **auto-discovered** from `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — you never list them in `plugin.json`.
- The command name comes from the **folder** name (`quality-review/` → `/personal:quality-review`), not the frontmatter `name`. Keep them equal to avoid confusion.
- Keep each `SKILL.md` focused (aim under ~500 lines); push detail into sibling files like `reference.md` and link to them one level deep.
- A skill `name` must be kebab-case, ≤ 64 chars. (Claude Code does **not** reserve `claude`/`anthropic` in skill names — a tool-specific name like `setup-claude-code` is fine.)
